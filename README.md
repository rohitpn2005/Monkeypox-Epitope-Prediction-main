Monkeypox Epitope Prediction

Introduction

This project is an in silico analysis using immunoinformatics tools to predict potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes from Monkeypox virus proteins. The primary objective is to identify promising epitope candidates that could be used in the design of a multi-epitope vaccine against the Monkeypox virus. The methodology typically involves a series of computational steps, including the prediction of antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic epitopes with high binding affinity to human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles. The aim is to contribute to the development of a specific vaccine for the virus.

Project Structure

A project of this nature would typically be organized as follows:

data/: Stores input data, such as protein sequences in FASTA format.

scripts/: Contains the scripts used for the bioinformatic and immunoinformatic analysis.

results/: Holds the output from the analysis, which would include predicted epitope sequences and their associated data.

notebooks/: May contain interactive analysis files, such as Jupyter Notebooks, for visualizing results and exploring data.

docs/: Includes documentation, figures, or presentations related to the project.

Technologies Used

This project likely utilizes a combination of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools and libraries. Common examples in this field include:

Programming Languages: Python, R

Libraries: Biopython, pandas, numpy

Online Servers: IEDB, NetMHCpan, VaxiJen, AllerTOP, ToxinPred
